Download the JDK 8 version:

You can determine which version of the JDK is the default by typing java -version in a Terminal window. If the installed version is 8u6, you will see a string that includes the text 1.8.0_06. For example:

% java -version
java version "1.8.0_06-ea"  (1.8.... is version 8 that's the one you need)
